\subsection{External}

The external context asks counterparts an \emph{opinion} about a candidate.
An opinion is the \emph{inner coherence} of the agent being asked. This context
plays crucial role in coherence property \ref{eq:coh-fun-independ}. It combines
the internal coherences of the agent itself and other agents, mentioned in the
assessed candidate.
