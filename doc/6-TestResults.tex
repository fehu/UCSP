\section{Results and Conclusions}

The negotiation was executed 5 minutes, during which 17 schedules were reported.
The best (last) one had \textbf{\emph{total coherence} estimated }$\mathbf{0.78}$.
Total coherence was assessed as \emph{geometric mean} of all participants'
internal coherence, that reflects schedule's concordance with \emph{personal preferences}.
$$ \coh_\Pi = \sqrt[\leftroot{-2}\uproot{2}n]
                   {\prod\limits_{a \in \{g\} \cup \{p\}}
                         \coh_a (\mathit{schedule})
                   }
$$

\noindent
Preferences values were assigned as:
$\begin{cases}
  1   & \text{if all the preferences were satisfied,} \\
  0.6 & \text{if some preferences were satisfied,}    \\
  0.1 & \text{if no preference was satisfied.}
\end{cases}$
