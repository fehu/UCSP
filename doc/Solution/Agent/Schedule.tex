\section{Schedule Holder Agents}
\label{sec:solution-schedule-var}

These agents hold \emph{common schedule variable} --- a fixed 3-dimensional table
\emph{Day} $\times$ \emph{Time} $\times$ \emph{Room} with variable
\emph{slots for classes}.

The variable can be stored by either singleton holder or a distributed agents network.
In both cases, actual holders can be hidden by a layer of interface agent(s).

In any case, the holder must provide following capabilities through messages:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Put candidate into the schedule. Results in either success or conflict.
        In latter case, the conflicting candidates are attached to the response.
  \item Put a candidate, removing conflicting candidates and notifying their
        creators. Requires a \emph{proof of superiority} for each atomic conflict.
        % (see section \ref{solution-compare})
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\noindent
In the same time, holder agent(s) must monitor schedule's state and report
possible solutions. A solution is considered \emph{complete} when
\begin{enumerate*}[1)]
  \item it contains candidates of all groups and
  \item is positively assessed in \emph{final} mode.
\end{enumerate*}

Complete solution can be assessed with \emph{total coherence}, by
evaluating \underline{all} agents' internal coherence values in \underline{final}
mode, and then applying the values to \emph{common goal} function $\Gamma$.

\subsection{Solution improvement}
\label{sec:solution-better}

After a solution has been reached and reported, the negotiation should continue
unless explicitly stopped or an error occurs. Negotiation goal is better
schedule, so the agents are required to provide better candidates for each next
solution.

Group agents are ``sleeping'' after successfully placing the candidates.
They are awoken by \emph{continuation demand}. On such demand, an agent
must guard its latest candidate's \emph{internal coherence} and use it as part
of candidates assessment process.
Internal coherence of new candidates should be no less than of the previous.

Professor agents also receive continuation message. They use internal coherence
of current candidate's projection as \emph{best coherence value}.
The comparison is performed only in \emph{final} coherence assessment mode.
