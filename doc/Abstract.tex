University \emph{class scheduling} problem (UCSP) is faced each academic term
by many institutes throughout the world. A sufficient number of classes must
be created and then assigned to the students and professors in such a way,
that persons' schedules don't intersect and the persons are (rather) satisfied
with the assignment. It is usually done manually.

While UCSP research has already started by 1960s,
no accessible computational equipment had the resources to handle the problem
in general and/or for entire universities until the recent times.
With rapid computer performance growth in the 1990s, computationally
difficult problems could be researched with minor expenses and many
solution search methods were developed for various kinds of problems.

\noindent
This \thisdoc\ proposes an extendable UCSP solution with support for
\emph{schedule personalization}. The latter means that the solutions takes
into account \emph{personal} preferences of the represented people.
It is achieved by using agent negotiations between the representatives of each
\emph{students/groups} and \emph{professors}. The representing agents permit defining
\emph{personal preferences} and \emph{restrictions}, that are used to optimize
the schedules.
