% \begin{abstract}  % TODO
% \emph{University classes scheduling} is an old, well-known problem, that
% was attacked by the researches only recently, as the advances in electronics,
% made in the last 10--15 years, permitted construction of computational
% systems, far more advanced than \red{\dots}
% \end{abstract}

% Solutions to the problem are the \emph{university schedules}, that are
% composed of \emph{individual schedules} for each \emph{group} (\emph{student}),
% \emph{professor} and \emph{classroom}.

% Individual schedules are represented by \emph{timetables}, that hold one's
% \emph{classes} for a week. % TODO: rewrite this!
% A \emph{class} denotes some activity for a group of students under professor's
% supervision, that takes place in the classroom assigned. Actual activity and
% therefore the requirements, imposed on both professor and classroom, are defined by the
% \emph{discipline} in question.

\begin{abstract}

University classes scheduling problem consists in assigning
the \emph{classes}, defined by the academic program, for
each group of students, possibly taking in account participants' interests.

The problem is solved by agents negotiation over possible classes
configurations. The \emph{negotiating agents} are grouped by \emph{roles}:
\emph{professors} (\emph{full} and \emph{part time}), \emph{students} (\emph{groups}) and
\emph{classrooms}. Each agent has the knowledge, required by it's role.

The \emph{configuration} quality is assessed by it's \emph{coherence}.
A solution must exceed some quality threshold.
