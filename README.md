# Thesis Project
University Time Scheduling Problem

The project uses [literate programming](https://wiki.haskell.org/Literate_programming) concept.

### Building

The project is intended to be build with [this forked version of spacemacs](https://github.com/fehu/spacemacs)
(an Emacs distribution).

When opening an `*.lhs` file, accept local variables application.

To build Haskell code, use <kbd>SPC H c b</kbd>.

To generate `dvi` document, use <kbd>SPC m b</kbd>.

To view the generated document, use <kbd>SPC m v</kbd>.


For more information, see
* [_Haskell layer_ documentation](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/tree/master/layers/%2Blang/haskell).
   
    **NOTE:** most keys have been redefined: <kbd> SPC m ...</kbd> â†’ <kbd>SPC H ...</kbd>
    in order to avoid collisions with _LaTeX layer_.
