#### Abstract

- [x]

#### Introduction

- [ ]


#### CSP

- [x] Graph coloring/n-queen problem diagrams.
- [ ] Write something about one of the techniques.
- [x] Distributed: rewrite or delete.
- [x] N-Queens lacks second diagonal constraint.

- [ ] Solutions: here or in Agents?

#### Agents

- [ ] Describe some N-queen problem resolution method (Weak Commitment Search).

#### Coherence

- [ ]

#### Solution

- [x] Describe what is _fold function_
- [x] Describe _Details_
- [ ] Edit for easier reading, add lacking details.
- [ ] Merge with Formal Problem Definition.

#### Solution: Group

- [x] replace fig:candidates-alone diagram
- [x] add solution diagram
- [x] add deep coherence diagram
- [x] extend deep coherence diagram

## From comments: lexical
- [x] better synonym for 'enrolled' => 'enrolled'.

## Misc

- [x] Fix Real symbol

## Describe assumptions/simplifications --- possible improvement
- [x] Timetable.
- [x] No part/full time professor separation: assumed to be handled by 'rareness'.
- [x] Classes splitting. Now a single class is created for each discipline,
      it can be improved by modifying 'Day – Time – Room' assignment strategy.
- [x] Students.
- [x] Rooms representation.
