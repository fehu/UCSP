\subsection{Professor Agents}

While being purely reactive (with no proactive behavior), professor agents
play a crucial role in the negotiation by merging groups' candidates.
Each group generates candidates containing only the classes it needs.
The professors, referenced by several candidates, can \emph{merge} them into a
single one. In order to merge candidates, the group agents that generated them
must be in \emph{negotiation state} (section \ref{sec:c-negotiation}).

A \emph{professor} agent has \emph{best candidate} variable, that holds the best
(in coherence terms) candidate seen (proposed or merged) by the professor.
It also has \emph{negotiable} variable, that holds the candidates, proposed for
negotiation.

\bigskip

\noindent
Let's consider the candidates, presented in figure \ref{fig:candidates-alone}.
They were generated by agents $G_1$, $G_2$ and $G_3$. Let's suppose that they
successfully passed \emph{inner coherence} assessment and now, they \emph{ask opinions}
of the references \emph{professors}.
