Classes scheduling is a \emph{constraints satisfaction problem} (CSP).
and all scheduling problems share a common constraint: schedule consistency ---
one cannot participate in several events at the same time. For the classes case,
the participants are:
\begin{enumerate*}
  \item \emph{groups} of students,
  \item teachers or \emph{professors},
  \item \emph{classrooms}.
\end{enumerate*}
The first two are represented by real people and the rooms are represented by
the institution.

Problem \emph{constraints} can be divided into:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \underline{Class constraints}: a class should be a productive event, so
    a professor should be able to \emph{teach} the class, the classroom should
    have the \emph{capacity} to hold all the students and be properly \emph{equipped},
    and the group should be \emph{inscribed} to class subject
    (further called \emph{discipline}).
  \item \underline{Time constraints}: no participant can have two classes
    at the same time (or intersecting in time), as mentioned before.
  \item \underline{Strong restrictions}: the restrictions, put on a participant, that
    \emph{must} be respected. May include working hours, fixed lunch recess time,
    and any other institution or person specific \emph{obligations}.
  \item \underline{Weak restrictions}: the restrictions, that \emph{should} be respected,
    but are not critical to the solution. Compliance with theese restrictions
    raises \emph{solution quality}, but it is assumed that the all of them
    cannot be fully met for all the participants --- they are intended to
    represent personal \emph{preferences}.
\end{enumerate}

The goal is finding a solution --- schedule, satisfying all the constraints.
University schedule is composed of \emph{individual schedules} for every
participant. An individual schedules may be seen as a day-time table with
classes in the cells. Therefore the complete schedule can be represented as a
3-dimentional table, as shown in figure \ref{fig:ScheduleSpace}.

During the last years the constraint satisfaction problems has been a popular
class of problems to research. Different algorithms and techniques where developed,
such as
\emph{dynamic constraint satisfaction based on extension particle swarm
      optimization algorithm} \cite{CSPswarm},
\emph{dynamic state bounding} \cite{CSPdynStateBound},
\emph{conflict-vector detection} \cite{CSPtimetable},
\emph{neural networks} \cite{CSPneuro},
\emph{ant colony optimization} \cite{CSPcunningACO, CSPlimmemACO},
\emph{selective hyper-heuristics} \cite{CSPhypHeur}
and \emph{agents} \cite{CSPagent2013, CSPagent2014, DCSPagent1998}.


The \emph{agent negotiation} approach is usually used for solving distributed
CSPs (DCSPs) \cite{DCSPagent1998, DCSP2013, CSPagent2014}.
In this case the constrains are \emph{distributed} among the agents instead of
being gathered in one place.

\red{Such constraints distribution is useful for the \emph{classes scheduling} problem
, because it permits to distribute not only the constraints, but also the solution. }
Each agent would be expected to \emph{negotiate} a suitable solution for its
``master'', without concerning itself with the schedules of the others.
Tthe combined solution can be obtained as soon as all the participants agree on
their timetables.
