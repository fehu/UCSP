\section{Professor Agents}
Professor agents are purely reactive --- act only in response to messages.
They don't have own candidates, but are referenced by those of the \emph{groups}.
Candidates report their \emph{opinions} as part of \emph{external coherence}
mechanism. They support solution improvement (see section \ref{sec:solution-better})
and apply it to the assessments.

Because the solution is formed in steps and professor agents play no active role
in it, professors' internal contexts might cause \emph{over-restrictions}, for
example minimal number of classes. In order to consider these cases,
\emph{context assessment modes} were introduced.

Tho modes in use are: \emph{preliminary}, that disables ``unsafe'' contexts' relations,
and \emph{final}.
