\chapter{ Conclusions and Improvements }
\label{chapter:improvements}

\section{ Conclusions }

This work proposes flexible solution to university class scheduling problems,
providing means to personalize (adopt to one's needs) the negotiation process and
therefore the resulting schedule. The personalization is divided into
\emph{obligations}, assigned by the institution and \emph{preferences},
defined by the represented persons. Both are used to estimate coherence of the
classes in the eyes of an individual and are defined using \emph{relations},
that stand for constraints. Internally, other constraints exist, standing
for classes formation logic and time non-intersection. The constraints of similar
origin are grouped by \emph{contexts}. The latter were proposed at \cite{UAB-Thesis}
in order to represent different logic for coherence assessment.

The notion of coherence, very wide, permits describing
almost any thinkable constraint, that from one side gives it great customization
properties, but on the other side makes it rather complicated to describe
simpler things.

While the results, obtained by test, can be considered adequate and
all the main objectives, stated by this \thisdoc were achieved,
the proposed solution is no doubt a subject for many improvements.


\section{ Improvements }

In the solution, presented by this \thisdoc\ some assumptions and
simplifications were made. In this section they are discussed and some
improvement/extension propositions are made.

\subsection{Timetable}
In current implementation time slots have no spaces between them and it is
assumed that each class includes the time needed by the persons to
move from room to room.

\medskip\noindent
Time margins around classes can be added in two ways:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Change timetable slots to include intervals
        (see figure \ref{fig:timetable-intervals-predef}).

  \item Use smaller discretization interval and modify time intersection function:
        either the beginning or end time of one class is in between of
        the \emph{modified} beginning and end time of another,
        where \emph{modified} time has the margin added
        (see figure \ref{fig:timetable-intervals-any}).
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Classes Splitting}

In current implementation a \underline{single class} is created for each
group's discipline, without considering the resulting length
(it only has to fit timetable).

The improvement can be made by modifying ``Day -- Time -- Room''
assignment strategy (see section \ref{sec:solution-DTR}).
In general such strategy would need:
\begin{enumerate*}[1)]
  \item class length limit,
  \item days ``distance'',
\end{enumerate*}
both possibly dependent on the discipline.
The classes for same discipline then should be assigned to the cores all together.

\subsection{Obligations and Preferences Descriptions}

The implementation of personal contexts' relations is based on functions,
described in section \ref{sec:solution-contexts}, that work with classes
either in pairs or over whole set. The latter one gives great flexibility.

\medskip
These functions are rather inconvenient for \underline{describing} the
obligations/preferences on practice. A \emph{Domain Specific Language}
(DSL) should be developed in order to describe personal constraints.
Such language must \underline{provide expressions} for:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Constraints over single class.
  \item Constraints between any two classes.
  \item Constraints over whole classes set.
  \item A way to weight and mix constraints descriptors.
\end{enumerate}

% % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % % %
\subsection{Default Preference Rules}
Some personal preferences should be provided by default and used by the agents
unless overridden. Such preferences should be established by the institution and
might be:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Classes per day.
  \item Time between classes.
  \item Preferred time range.
  \item Classes per week distribution.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Those preferences reflect institution scheduling policy.

\subsection{Full-/Part- Time Professors}
Apart from \emph{full-time} working professors, many universities contract
\emph{part-time} professors, that work only some pre-established hours.
Such professors can have different rules for classes assignment, depending on
the institution.

The distinction between professor types wasn't implemented, because it isn't
general case. However, assuming that \emph{part-time} professors are contracted
to teach classes, that no or few full-time professor can, the classes of former
professor type would usually receive higher \emph{discipline priority} and
therefore assigned first. That strategy corresponds with the fact that part-time
professors have stronger restrictions (in \emph{obligations} internal context)
over classes time, because of limited working hours.

If other behavior is needed when dealing with \emph{part-time} professors, then
it can be achieved by extending \texttt{Professor} role constructor and matching
concrete role in agents' behavior functions.

\subsection{Students Representation}
\label{sec:improvements-students}

The biggest assumption made in this \thisdoc\ is that the groups are preformed
and \emph{each student belongs strictly to one group}. This permits to handle
groups completely ignoring the underlying students, thus simplifying schedule
negotiation.
The assumption makes it impossible to resolve a large subclass of UCSPs, where
the groups are not fixed, but formed for each discipline from the students
that need it.

Basing the negotiation on \emph{students} would require a new preceding stage:
\underline{group formation}. Groups should be formed dynamically by students in
order to represent them in negotiation with professors. Different strategies
could be used for groups creation, that would depend on group size limits.
In general, initially a minimal set of groups (with maximum students possible)
should be created for each discipline, possibly by students negotiation.
More groups can be created later to separate some students, causing conflicts;
of course all group size restrictions must be respected by newly created
group and its ``donors''. A less radical way to change groups composition is
student transfer.

A group is formed by students to study specific discipline (or a set of
explicitly linked ones). All the classes of a group would have the same professor.
In this negotiation scheme, a group would have no more constraints of its own.
All coherence assessment is passed down to the underlying students and then
combined. On figures \ref{fig:ScheduleHypercube-S} and
\ref{fig:ConnectionMatrixDiff} the differences in agents connection organization
are presented.

As in the original negotiation, a group should be responsible for candidate
creation and placement, representing the underlying students in \underline{all}
the communications. Therefore the negotiation scheme would remain unchanged
(see chapter \ref{chapter:solution} and figure \ref{fig:solution-flow}).
The modification would only affect group proactive behavior:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Internal coherence assessment would interrogate student agents.
  \item A group could not only change the candidate, but also request changes
        to groups compositions.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip\noindent
Proxying would complicate the resulting relations between the agents, so
some tests are needed to make further implementation suggestions.

\subsection{Classrooms Representation}
It is possible to make the classrooms a represented entity, by creating
corresponding agent \emph{role} and changing the \emph{class-cores}.
Then the classrooms can have internal contexts of their own, and their
\emph{opinions} would be included by external coherence evaluation.
Agents connections in case of students and classrooms representation are shown
on figure \ref{fig:ConnectionMatrixAll}.
